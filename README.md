RT-universal
============

The purpose of this repository is to share a set of radiative transfer models in python and C++.

Several codes will be shared:
- python codes, showing test codes, simplified radiative transfer models
- c++ codes, more optimized
- python/c++ codes using CUDA for optimal performances

The plan is to test the concepts with the python codes, and to develop further optimized codes.

The main objective is to have a radiative transfer model:
- adapted to spherical geometries (1D with spherical symmetry)
- adapted for IR/UV/visible
- with frequency redistribution (partial or total)
